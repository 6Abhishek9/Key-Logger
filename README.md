# Key-Logger
I built a custom keylogger for ethical testing and learning, capturing real-time keystrokes using low-level Windows API hooks. Logs are sent to a local PHP server via HTTP POST for centralized collection. Implemented secure data handling, console hiding, and tested across local environments using PHPâ€™s built-in server.
